For a Terraform project, you'll want to ignore several types of files to keep your repository clean and secure. Here's what I'd recommend adding to your .gitignore file:
# Local .terraform directories
**/.terraform/*

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which might contain sensitive data
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they're usually used for local development
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# Ignore lock files - optional, some teams prefer to version these
# .terraform.lock.hcl

# Ignore plan output files
tfplan
*.tfplan

# Ignore sensitive variable files
*.auto.tfvars
